This is a project to make a 2D, pixel-styled game, where you get to make your own worlds using the ingame tools, join servers, play with friends, etc.
Of course this is a WIP project, and it's still in beta 1.0, in fact, the only playable thing is the main menu. But hey, stuff will get going.

ROADMAP (It's literally everywhere):
- [x] Main Menu
- [x] UI system
- [x] Window actually appearing
- [x] Fonts
- [ ] Make singleplayer work
- [ ] Make multiplayer work
- [ ] Make avatar work
- [ ] Make settings work
- [ ] Make exit work
- [ ] Settings.ini to actually exist, load, save, and all that
- [ ] Avatar.json to also exist, load, save, and all that (tho I don't think it'll be that hard)
- [ ] Easter eggs (of course)
- [ ] Achievements
- [ ] Microtransactions (it's a joke)
- [ ] World gen (haugh)
- [ ] Server engine
- [ ] Make the music (yeah this will take a while)
- [ ] Make the SFX
