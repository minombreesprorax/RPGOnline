Hello! Porpro99 here, the dev.

Yes, annoyingly, this file will pop up every time you open a beta, but it'll stay like that until the program goes to alpha, and no, there's no way to disable it.

I'm here to say. Thank you for playing the RPGOnline beta, this'll be the changelog until it gets implemented ingame, and it'll be located as a button in the settings menu.

Also, if you want to use any of the modules this project uses, using them directly or chunks of code, I won't stop you, as this project of mine doesn't intend to be too private, so you can look at the source code in github, or in the data files, because until the game enters release, I won't compile it.

CHANGELOG:
 + Created RPGONLINE
 + Made the Main Menu
 + Made the V1.0 bg art (I know I suck at it, but it isn't that bad, right?)

DONE:
 * Main Menu
 * UI system
 * Window actually appearing
 * Fonts

LEFT FOR RELEASE:
 * Make singleplayer work
 * Make multiplayer work
 * Make avatar work
 * Make settings work
 * Make exit work
 * Settings.ini to actually exist, load, save, and all that
 * Avatar.json to also exist, load, save, and all that (tho I don't think it'll be that hard)
 * Easter eggs (of course)
 * Achievements
 * Microtransactions (it's a joke)
 * World gen (haugh)
 * Server engine
 * Make the music (yeah this will take a while)
 * Make the SFX

*Probably more stuff will be added in the "left for release" part, but for now, that's all.
